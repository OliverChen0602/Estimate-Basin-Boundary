    "An estimation about basin boundary is good if it classifies points near the boundary well. Therefore, to obtain a dataset which consists of many near-boundary points is desirable for us to subsequently train our model. We adapt the following approach: Consider an attractor of interest from the given dynamical system. We start from uniformly sampled points from the region of interest, then we separate the sampled points into two(+ and -) classes, depending on whether the trajectory starting from the point will tend to the attractor. We consider all pairs of data points, where for each pair one point is taken from the positive class and the other is taken from the negative class. For such a pair, since they belong to different classes, the actual boundary must go in between them. We perform bisection to narrow down the margin of estimation until the margin becomes smaller than $\\delta$ ($\\delta$ is a hyperparameter to control precision of estimation). We then save those points close to the boundary as a dataset."

We have obtained an initial dataset of 100,000 points by sampling from $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}) \\in (-50,50)\\times (-50,50) \\times (-50,50)$ uniformly at random and compute their trajectories."
